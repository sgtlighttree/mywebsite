> Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.
>
> ## What I've accomplished
>
> 1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.
>
> 2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.
>
> 3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!
>
> ## What's next
>
> I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

At least, that's what the tutorial told me to put.

In truth, Astro feels much more modern to develop on, and it should be. It automatically updates all changes to the site on save, the files are much more organized, and the tutorials were easy to follow.
