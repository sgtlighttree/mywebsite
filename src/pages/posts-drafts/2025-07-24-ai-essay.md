Working Titles:
- Algorithms are the New Hephaestus
- The Modern Hephaestus Shaping our Minds is Math
- When Machines Molded Our Minds (selected)

Ideas
- Core Idea: Actions and ideas once seemed unthinkable are now mainstream thanks to social media algorithms rewarding posts of such actions and ideas, no matter the reception.
- Wordplay on “mold”, a verb meaning “to shape a substance into a form”, but also mold as in “rot” to let our brains rot by said algorithms, and now GenAI.
    - Point of irony: try to use AI models to help draft this essay
- Tangent: Adds to Gen Z’s fear of being perceived, as such perceptions posted on social media are again      incentivized by algorithms.
- Algorithms have created a panopticon society.

Things to do for this Essay:
- Explore the Hephaestus myth if we can connect it to the core idea somehow.
