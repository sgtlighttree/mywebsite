_(archived from [V1](https://web.archive.org/web/20241005154048/https://sgtlighttree.github.io/mywebsite/) of the website.)_

I've always wanted to create my own website and further learn how to code, but my current interest in media derailed that a bit.

Until I saw this video from a certain NetworkChuck called ["you STILL need a website RIGHT NOW!! (yes, even in 2024)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXfFBEuCAr0). I've looked at solutions like WordPress or Adobe Portfolio, but this guy actually managed to break through my FUD and apathy by giving me excellent reasons to make my own website.

As much as I wanted to create a good website with a website builder, I wanted to learn how to code again, at least with HTML and CSSâ€”I wanted to have the granular control with directly editing my website's code itself, as well as familiarity with what I'm making, even if most of the code was made with ChatGPT. I used [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), as my code editor, a telemetry-free version of VSCode. It is functionally similar to Microsoft's version of the <code>vscode</code> repo. 

As for the domain, I want to settle for a good design and functionality before getting one, but Hostinger seems to be the best choice, second is Namecheap, but the former only charges with USD Really though, I don't need a proper domain for now, fingers crossed someone won't take it, but job security seems to be pretty okay at the moment.

UPDATE 9:20 PM So I attempted to use two instances of vscodium to simultaneously develop my website. Having Resilio sync connect the two repositories together really messed things up. I also measured the time it takes for Github Pages to finish deployment after committing, and it takes around 30-40 seconds. Not bad.
