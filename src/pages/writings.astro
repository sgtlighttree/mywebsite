  <h2>Skybound Saga</h2>
  <p>
  Skybound Saga is a science-fantasy speculative fiction project that took flight in 2016. While it is primarily a work of literature, it is also supported by pieces of visual art to present the depth of its world. The project centers around the Drarthers: a race of half-human, half-dragon hybrids capable of magic. Coursing through their veins, their magic is powered by Metaquarks; mysterious sub-atomic fundamental particles, able to manipulate matter and the fundamental forces of the universe.
  <br><br>
  Like many speculative fiction projects, much time and care was spent crafting histories, cultures, factions, states, languages, and many facets of civilization to fully immerse oneself into the Saga. It also mixes dragon myths from all over the world, combining Asian dragons, western dragons, and other dragon-like creatures from the Americas and Africa. It even introduces ‘alien dragons’ into the mix, further combining scientific and fantastic elements.
