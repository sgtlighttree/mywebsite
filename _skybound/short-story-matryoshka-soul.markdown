The young Prince Alforn of the House of Kairos was pacing around his room, his dragon-like wings wide open. Dark gray with blue accents. An ethereal figure was standing in front of him, unmoving. He too had wings, a dirty white with red streaks. Their clothing were in stark contrast against each other. While the prince wore colorful and well-tailored pieces suited for flight, the man in front of him had torn, shabby clothes.

“So let me get this straight, Vrakeus,” Alforn said, sitting on a plush chair. “You are a voice in my head.”

“Yes, and no,” said the figure in front of him. Vrakeus was half-visible, his body fading in and out of existence. “If I was, I would not be here standing in front of you. I am a lost soul in search of a body. I am only using yours as a temporary solution, but so far it has been far from it.”

“Why did you leave your body anyway?”

“I—”

“You wanted immortality?”

“Yes, and no. However—”

Alforn rolled his eyes. “For Klerga’s sake, can you stop being so cryptic?”

“I would return the favor if you stop interrupting me, young prince,” Vrakeus said, his eyes flashing a faint red. “If you had already read some of the books behind you, they were right in calling me a long-lived Drarther. The rest of them were wrong about calling me an immortal. My body certainly wasn’t. Even us being half-dragons can only help so much.”

“So that’s why there were rumors that you died about three hundred years ago. You’re telling me this whole time you haven’t found a host?”

“Your mother Relinda was a satisfactory one.”

Alforn sat up in his chair. “You had been the one she was hearing?”

Vrakeus sighed. “Yes, and also no. It is very complicated. Have you seen a Matryoshka doll from the lands of Russia on Earth?”

“You mean those dolls that have smaller dolls inside? I’ve seen those.”

“Think of it like this. A soul in a soul… in an another soul. A hyperparasite.”

“I don’t understand.”

Vrakeus looked at him. “Did you remember your psychology lessons during your time at school? How all Drarthers have a strong voice inside their head?”

“Yeah.” Alforn raised an eyebrow. “You mean, _you_ have a voice inside your... head? My head? _Our_ head?”

Vrakeus smiled, then nodded. “Now you’re getting it. Only I can hear it most of the time. I call him Volkorrn.”

Alforn did not know what to say. Vrakeus found a chair near him, and sat down. “You must have heard Volkorrn at least once.”

“Oh, that one bastard who keeps me up at night? I know him!”

“If you only knew just how much he kept _me_ up awake,” Vrakeus said, laughing. “But you must be ready for when he takes over from me. My soul may not have much left. He has taken a lot of mine.”

Alforn looked at him. “So what do I do?”

A pause. “I don’t know.”

Alforn stood up. “What? You have to know! You’re two thousand years old! You must at least know what happens when two people are in the same body.”

“I know that,” Vrakeus said. “Many have done it before. But there is no precedent for a soul within a soul having it’s own parasite. Even two thousand years is not enough for me to gain such knowledge.

“You will be on your own. You must stand your ground. If does not happen by then, then my soul will be passed on to one of your twin sons. You will not hear from me since.”

“Why my sons?” Alforn couldn’t contain his revulsion. His wings rose. “You can’t get them involved in your bullshit quest for immortality!”

“It is unfortunately unavoidable. Sooner or later he will have to face me or Volkorrn, and you must guide him.”

Alforn sat down again, head under his hands. “If my body dies before my sons are born, what will happen to you?”

“Maybe I could finally pass on. Or maybe not. I haven’t been in contact with my fellow soul-sharers ever since. And even if one of their hosts died, I wouldn’t be able to tell if they have truly passed on.”

“~~Shit~~ Tant’are.”

A rattling noise came from beside Alforn. It was his jewellery cabinet. Vrakeus was pointing at it, making gestures with his fists.

“What are you doing?”

“I am making you a necklace. Something to aid in our communications.”

A short rope, a dozen pearls and one sapphire gem emerged from the cabinet. “Until now I did not know talking to you like this consumes part of your energy. This sapphire mined from the caves of Maralo gives its wearer a Mind Affinity. Hence its mountainous price.”

“I didn’t notice talking to you wore me down, but thanks for the heads up,” Alforn said, looking at the gems as they attached themsleves to the rope. The necklace went for Alforn’s neck. As soon as the necklace touched his skin, it flashed. Alforn was blind for a few moments. Then, Vrakeus’s figure became clearer.

“See?” Vrakeus’s voice also changed. His voice did seem to come from the other side of the room, instead of an echo inside his head. “One day, when your sons live to the age of three, my soul will pass on to one of them. You will know who it will be. When that happens, you will not hear from me since.”

“How will I know?”

“By knowing who was the firstborn. You should have noticed that by now. This necklace, I hope, will also prevent Volkorrn from communicating with you and then your son.”

Alforn touched the necklace. “So one of my sons will bear this curse while the other is left unscathed?”

“It is better than the alternative.”

“What is?”

“_My_ soul in two.”

(maybe cut the story here)

“I don’t like what I’m hearing.”

Vrakeus stared at him.

“Are you saying _your_ soul gets passed on to one of the twins, while the other gets that bastard?”

“Unfortunately, that might be the case.”

Alforn sat down, his legs weak. “How can I stop this?”

“There are only a few ways to stop a soul parasite/leech, as I’d like to call him.”

“Give it to me, then. Anything.”

Vrakeus sighed. “We may have to eliminate the host once Volkorrn is in their body.”

Alforn stood up. “My sons are not your hosts.”

“You are right. But if in the right conditions, we may be able to eliminate my soul and Volkorrn’s in your sons’ bodies.”

“I don’t want ‘may’. I want to be sure of it.”

“The right time will come. Volkorrn thinks he’s strong, but he is merely feeding off of whatever energies are left in my soul. You must play the long game, as I have done.”

“And you’re sure he doesn’t know what we’re talking about?”

Vrakeus laughed. “I have my ways to isolate him from myself, young prince. He’s been with me for the past two millenia!”
