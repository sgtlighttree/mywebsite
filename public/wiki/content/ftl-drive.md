# The Alcubierre-Tarsus FTL Drive

The primary method of faster-than-light travel is the A-T Drive. It functions by creating a bubble of localized spacetime that is moved, rather than the ship itself.

### Principles

- Contracts spacetime in front of the vessel.
- Expands spacetime behind it.
- The ship remains in a pocket of flat, unperturbed space.
