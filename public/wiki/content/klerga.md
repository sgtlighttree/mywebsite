Klerga - Geography, Cosmology, and Civic Systems

# History

---

During the Adaptation and Interaction Ages, [[Drarthers]] and Humans were very hostile to each other. Drarthers were able to overpower humans in the short term, but they almost always lost out on humans’ key advantage: numbers. While Drarthers have the ability to collaborate, the sheer force of numbers by humans ultimately led to Drarthers isolating themselves. Higher casualties and a period of low reproductive rate also accelerated this change.

Larger Drarther settlements have also existed, even within human communities. The largest independent Drarther settlement is thought to have located between the Fertile Crescent and the Pontic-Caspian Steppes, also near human settlements. The largest Drarther settlements where they have lived with humans is located in Mesoamerica. Records and evidence of these settlements are either hidden from humans or deliberately destroyed, often by organizations like The Congregation.

In 1347 to 1380 CE, humans around the world rediscovered Drarther settlements and began to attack them. The reasons for this sudden, widespread discovery are debated, but a dominant theory states that Vrakeus might have been involved, and even within that theory, his potential motives are unclear.

In Europe however, the cause is well-known: Humans accused Drarthers of spreading the Black Plague. There is evidence of the disease originating from a Drarther researcher, who failed to keep their test subjects in control. Whether or not Vrakeus was involved is unclear. (A/N: Vrakeus was involved, but he was heavily influenced by Volkorrn.)

## The Conference of Communities

Often hailed as the greatest Drarthers of their time, Okanor the Great from the Holy Roman Empire, Helga the Strong of Mesoamerica, Kalaiz Halin from the Mali Empire, and Nami Yamamoto of East Asia got together to create a settlement for all Drarthers. Today, they are collectively called [[The Founders]]

The Four met each other during their independent travels around the world. In 1348, they organized the first worldwide conference of Drarther communities on Earth, now called the Conference of Communities. The location is alleged to be near current-day Rabat, the capital of Morocco. Some allege that the conference actually happened in Jerusalem instead.

The Conference of Communities is a biennial event, held since its first in 1348. In the first Conference, they discussed potential solutions to the prosecution of their species. The solution came from an unlikely source: a child, belonging to an African community. The child suggested islands in the sky to isolate themselves from humans.

Okanor the Great welcomed the proposal, but Kalaiz Halin, one of the first Drarthers to gain an Astral Affinity, took it one step further: the island will be built outside of Earth.

At first, a majority of the communities rejected the proposal, saying that it is too ambitious, risky, and far-fetched. The other Founders showed a degree of skepticism. Eventually, Okanor and Kalaiz proved that the idea was possible by showing the audience their great feats of power.

Still, a compromise had to be made. The majority of the communities’ Representatives accepted Proposal C, which in its summary stated that “Klerga must be built within Earth, furthest from any permanent human settlement or landmass, or any landmass that has the potential to support permanent human settlements, and a Mechanism to move Klerga out of Earth when necessary.”

[methods of creation: bombarding asteroids, pulling matter from the Earth, stealing large quantities of water from comets, etc.]

## Settlement

Klerga was first settled by the four peoples associated with the Founders: Raitos, Thozeta, Halde'it, and Klazen. There were many smaller peoples and groups too, but they were absorbed by the nacsent nations.

[[The Youngs]] are the living heirs of the ancient nations.

# Geography and Cosmology

---

Klerga is a celestial body located in Earth-Sun Lagrange Point 3. It is a cone-shaped structure with a mantle of solid rock, and a hollow core inside its bottom. The part of the island facing the sun is subjected to direct heat and solar winds from the Sun.

Inside of the hollow core is the machinery that keeps the celestial body functioning. Klergans call it the **Feraolkam**, which is High/Standard Klergan for "earth machine". The self-contained machine makes use of [[Metaquarks]] to keep the celestial island functioning, to cloak it within the cosmos, and keep it safe from other celestial objects travelling through the Solar system. The “bottom” or southern tip of the island is orientated facing the Sun. 

A Quarkstar, made up of supercompressed and heated metaquarks, serves as Klerga’s source of light and heat apart from the Sun. A Quarkmoon serves a similar purpose.

Planning for Klerga started in 1348, right after the first Conference of Communities. The plans were roughly finished after ten years in 1358, after the Founders have successfully scouted two locations. One, Point Nemo, which served as Klerga’s ancestral location up until 1945, where the first nuclear bombs were detonated. (See: [[The Second Great Exit - Klerga’s Reaction to Humanity's Nuclear Testing]])

For the Mechanism, a region of the solar system. They wanted a place isolated enough that humans couldn't reach, but also close enough so that wormholes between Klerga and Earth wouldn't take so much energy and effort to make.

## Construction and Infrastructure

### Oceanic Era

Making use of the great Vaya Castillo’s maps of the Earth, made during her multiple circumnavigations in the 1200s, the Founders looked for the most remote location on Earth. They settled on a point on Earth they called Dragonwomb currently called Point Nemo by Humanity.

What Castillo’s maps missed is an already substantial floating island above such a point. Why and how the proto-island was built remains a mystery to Drarthers to this day (see *Role as Alien Outpost*). Nevertheless, the Founders determined that the island as they found was too small at the time and for the future. They devised a plan to expand the island to its current size today.

Klerga's expansion and formation over Point Nemo took forty years, between 1360 and 1400 CE.  The Founders, used the metaquarks within them to move massive amounts of earth, water, flora and fauna to form the island. The total surface land area of Klerga is 40,000km2, about the size of Switzerland. 

The Feraolkam was first built to resist Earth’s gravity and keep the island floating within the Earth, about 2,500km or about 8200 feet above sea level. The magical machine formed gigantic clouds and gale force winds around the island to keep outsiders out. The sea below was also affected by the atmospheric manipulation. Constant storms and lightning plagued the waters below Klerga. The machine, when necessary, generates large waterspouts to help collect water in times of drought.

### Cosmic Era

Kalaiz Halin and Okanor The Great built the mechanism that is to be used in the event that Klerga needed to be moved out of Earth. They used the metaquarks within them to travel to the outer reaches of the solar system, and manipulate the universe's resources. They formed a wormhole to travel between Earth and Klerga easily. 

The Feraolkam generates gravity for Klerga, and in turn generates a a spherical magnetic field to keep its Earth-like atmosphere intact, and to keep the water flowing on the cone from evaporating. It also generates auroras on the edges of the world during the Sun's more intense bursts of energy. The land of the body is composed of four large islands, and many smaller ones. It is surrounded by water at its sides. The water 'falls' off the edge of the world, but the water sticks to the bottom of the rocky cone through surface tension, aided by the Feraolkam, and is slowly absorbed the soft parts of the cone to rise slowly to either become groundwater, or back to the sea. Additional water is added through capturing icy comets. The comets are either caught by Klerga's gravity, or delivered by probes launched from the celestial island.

To avoid detection, comets are checked against Earthly and Klergan databases. If the object is not known to Earth, then the comet is harvested per normal procedures. Otherwise, a “replacement comet” is sent with a similar mass but different chemical properties, like trash or old space equipment. In some scenarios, the new fake comet is dusted or wrapped with materials with similar chemical properties as the old comet.

Below Klerga is a machine that redirects solar winds and radiation and converts them to energy for the celestial island. The underside of the island absorbs the solar energy and provides power to the Feraolkam.

There is no active plate tectonics in the island, meaning that mountains and other features were arbitrarily placed by the Founders, or by other powerful Drarthers.

The Founders intended Klerga to be a close to Earth as possible, so this means that time in Klerga works nearly the same way as on Earth. A Klergan year is the same as an Earth year, based on the Gregorian calendar—but the Gregorian calendar was only adopted at around 1600 CE, meaning there was no concrete way of timekeeping before then. The day-night cycle is also the same, aided by the ball of light—made of metaquarks, of course—revolving above and below the island.

> In modern terms, Klerga is pretty much "backwards-compatible" with Earth.

## Climate

At the edge of the island, where the Horizon Auroras can be found, and in center of the island where the Feraolkam is located, the climate ranges from tropical to a warm temperate, with notable patches of desert. In this area, the year is divided into a wet and dry season. Temperatures are generally warm compared to the rest of the island.

In between those two sections, called in Klergan as **[insert word]**, literally meaning “many-weather-place”, a ranging from a colder temperate climate to continental. The seasons are divided into the typical four-season pattern.

## Role as Alien Outpost

While Kalaiz Halin was scouting the Earth for a likely place for his people to call home, he found an unlikely place: a large, rocky island directly above Point Nemo. With his powers, he considered moving Klerga to the Asteroid Belt or one of its dwarf planets, but he calculated that collisions can happen often. He was wrong about this, however. Collisions in the Asteroid Belt, while possible, is highly unlikely.

The other founders had their concerns about the mysterious island. While they did recognize its distance from any human settlements, they suspected that something was suspicious about it. Halin was able to convince them that the island was safe for them to build on.

In reality, the island was formed by the Entropids to watch over the Drarthers’ evolution (they ignored Humans). They abandoned it shortly after they determined that Drarthers won’t advance to form societies (or clash with others), but they were wrong. Before they left, one of them left a sensor that will trigger should an MBH/MBB stumble upon it. It is located somewhere within the island’s rocky core. So far it has not yet been discovered, but one day it will.

## Countries in Klerga

---

Main article:

[[Countries of Klerga]]

**Kingdom of Ochan**  
The Kingdom of Ochan is the oldest country in Klerga, having been founded in 1404. It has a constitutional monarchy and a bicameral parliament. The country is known for having the strongest economy in Klerga, but its culture is starting to be overshadowed by modern Human life. It is also a popular destination for Humans that have escaped Earth. The current ruling monarch is King Hernaj, and the Royal House of Kairos is still allowed to exist under the constitution.  

**Federal Republic of Thoris**  
The Federal Republic of Thoris is a federation of six city-states with a high degree of autonomy. Its government is similar to Switzerland's, with a direct democracy for country-wide laws. Thoris has the strongest military in Klerga and is known for its great industrial workforce. The country is divided into six city-states, with each city-state divided into several districts and one "Economic Specialty Town."  

**Sacred Kingdom of Maralo**  
The Sacred Kingdom of Maralo is a semi-absolute monarchy with an elected prime minister and unicameral legislature. Its culture is built on religious law, and it is a religious center for many Drarthers. The House of Haralka exerts power over its citizens with a powerful Spiritual Guards, made up of senior priests and a larger number of inquisitors. Despite the House's strict implementation of Kailo'i Law, their primary principle is the use of “non-violent force.”  

**Klagon Socialist Confederacy**  
The Klagon Socialst Confederacy is the youngest of the four countries, having been founded in 1678. It is a scientific nation, with them giving the most contributions to Metaquark research. Klagon is a confederation of eight autonomous communes. They have strong ties with Ochan as partners in industry and naval power. They are currently facing separatist movements in the north of them.

### Other Details on Klergan Geopolitics

- Militaries still exist in Klerga for the sole purpose of border and sea control. While they may enjoy good diplomatic ties with each other, Drarthers are known to be very territorial. The only times they make use of the military other than border control is to protect from threats outside of the celestial body, such as satellites, or incorporeal, cosmic beings. Their military may be small in numbers, but their firepower is unmatched, even rivaling some of the most powerful ones on Earth.
- Ideologies, of course, differ from each country, but they aren't met with much animosity. Drarthers, despite their territorial tendencies, are very hospitable with non-threatening fellows, once they have proven themselves as a non-threat. Many Klergans enjoy living in both countries in their lifetimes, and some even having dual allegiance. One noted Drarther, Nalia Kaluz, had citizenships from all four countries.
    - Drarthers in general are very tolerant of each other. Baximus Hala once wrote:
        
        > "With how minuscule we are as a species, it will be foolish of us to start infighting, to break into smaller factions. It is the best interest of us to instill a principle of collective altruism."
        
- On Kailo'i Law:
    - Only Ochan does not implement it in their country as a whole, but some towns mandate parts of it. In their constitution, the country "must establish a secular state, free with any favor nor judgment towards any religion or belief, or lack of beliefs."
    - Thoris and Klagon implement certain rules of Kailo'i Law, such as dietary restrictions, workplace activities, cultural events, and others. The laws, however, are often lightly enforced and met with light penalties.
    - Maralo's implementation of Kailo'i Law is often met with criticism. Ochanites often say that their implementation restricts basic freedoms, taking cues from Humanity's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Thorisians and Klagonians say that Kailo'i Law should be an "optional supplement" in Drarther life, and that it shouldn't be imposed heavily on everyone. Maralo's defense however, is that Kailo'i Law is a part of Drarther culture and should not be seen as a tool of opression, but rather a tool for happiness.
