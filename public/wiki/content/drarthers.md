# The Drarthers - The Drarthers - Origins, History, and Biology

> Once there were dragons that roamed the Earth. Fearsome creatures they were, and all animals feared and respected them. Despite their appearance that looked to contradict the natural patterns of animal evolution, they were able to survive, hunt, and fly through their possession of Metaquarks: special particles that manipulate physical matter. It was only a matter of time when Humans bearing these particles would rise. Then, an incredible fusion of the two species emerged, united by their possession of these mysterious particles. We, the Drarthers, are the living fossils of the Dragons that once roamed the world and its skies. They are our ancestors, more or less.

Taken from the book _On Our Origins_, written by Drarther philosopher and historian Baximus Hala.



The Drarthers (sci. name Homo Draconis) are a race of sentient, dragon-like humanoids. Features that separate them from humans are wings, claws, eye colors not present or uncommon in Humans, fangs, forked tongues, pointed ears, patches of scales around their skin, and the blue blood that runs through their veins.

The origin of the English name come from the words 'Dragon' and 'Earther', but various names have also been used to call the species, like Drakhom, a portmanteau of the words “Drakon” and “Homo”. In High and Standard Klergan, they call themselves 'Drater'.

## Metaquark-Bearing Humans and the Early Drarthers

The first human that bore [[Metaquarks]], particles that manipulate matter, is estimated to have emerged 100,000 years ago. They were biologically identical to the Homo Sapiens, except for this trait. These particular kind of humans are called Metaquark-Bearing Humans or MBHs. The MBHs had a very high death rate, due to their bodies initially not being able to handle the particles' power. During this period, the living Dragons of their time, in all shapes and forms, attacked them specifically, due to both species' possession of metaquarks. This is when the first Drarthers emerged.

However, not all MBHs were attacked by dragons, some living perfectly normal lives as human beings. As time went on, the MBHs were slowly able to take advantage of the metaquarks within them, a phenomenon known to regular Humans as magic.

Dragon attacks on early Drarthers infected them with draconic DNA in the process, which gave them a better ability to handle the metaquarks within them. Some dragons were able to shapeshift into humanoid figures and were able to inseminate draconic DNA through such forms, or directly gave birth to the early Drarthers.

The metaquarks, combined with the small amount of draconic genome, accelerated their evolution away from their Homo Sapiens cousins. This evolution lead to the emergence of dragon-like features in them, like wings. Some draconic features also emerged, but quickly became extinct, such as the ability to breathe fire. They were both put down by humans and Drarthers alike because of the sheer danger they posed to life, or ended up perishing by themselves due to accidents caused by their powers.

As Drarthers adapted to the particles; their metabolisms became more efficient, and gained greater strength. Their wings grew slightly wider, and their lifespans grew faster, making them reach modern life expectancy thousands years before their Homo Sapiens cousins did. Even though Drarthers were now far and wide within Earth, the ~~quantum entanglement~~ mutual connection of the metaquarks helped to parallelize their evolution, apart from other traits, like wing shapes, hair, skin color, or eye color.

## Early History

### Adaptation Age

Over time, human civilizations saw these early Drarthers as formidable creatures, and treated them with the same respect and fear as other larger predators at the time. However, as languages and culture developed in both civilizations of Humans and Drarthers, a shared animosity formed.

Larger Drarther settlements have also existed, even within human communities. The largest independent Drarther settlement is thought to have been located between the Fertile Crescent and the Pontic-Caspian Steppes, also near human settlements. The largest Drarther settlements where they have lived with humans is located in Mesoamerica. Records and evidence of these settlements are either hidden from humans or deliberately destroyed, often by organizations like The Congregation.

The main reason they were not able wipe out Humans, despite their physical superiority, is the constant hunting of them. The Drarthers also have a slightly lower average fertility rate than humans, which meant they were almost always outnumbered in their battles against Human tribes.

Drarthers stayed this way, hidden from Humans for their survival. Their lifestyle did not change until their technological progress coincided with Humanity's. They also became conscious of a 'power' within them, but were not able to make use of it.

### Interaction Age

With their emerging power, and improved physical features, many Drarthers tried to mingle with Humans again. They failed, however, due to the Humans' fear of the unknown. Most of them killed Drarthers over their similarities of monsters, demons, and other creatures in their folklore. Some civilizations even added their own versions of the Drarthers in their stories.

Persecution of Drarthers lasted long, with Humans expending their resources to rid the world of them. Drarthers lived in caverns, and in (occasionally literal) underground societies. Sometimes, good-willing humans would understand their plight and help them. Unfortunately, many of them were executed once they were discovered.

Things changed until the founding of the first Drarther organization in 560 BCE in Athens. They were called the Sentinels, which sought to help hide the Drarthers and form safe communities where they can live, away from Human eyes. Many other organizations were founded with the same purpose. There was little, if any non-hostile competition between the groups. Historians determined that animosity within a small, hunted race was never going to do them any favors. Between these groups around the world, shared cultures were formed, and shadow economies emerged.

The Drarther world was shaken when Vrakeus rose into power in 20 CE. Vrakeus is a very powerful Drarther, and one of the early few that was actually able to harness the power of the metaquarks. This led him to being biologically immortal. He invited his fellow Drarthers to wage wars against Humans, to take revenge for their fallen compatriots. His ideas would prove polarizing, however. Many Drarthers were against the idea, but there were as many Drarthers that believed his ideology.

He then formed The Windwakers, a militant, violent, misanthropic group dedicated to Drarther supremacy. Vrakeus would then proceed to murder his most staunch critics, which were met with widespread anger. This was also the time he took down the Sentinels, scattering Drarthers across Eurasia apart. This also led to increased Windwaker membership. He was able to gain progress on his mission, using his prodigious talent for using metaquarks to trigger massive natural disasters that decimated human populations in the known world. Soon after however, he was forced to go underground due to several unsuccessful campaigns against Human civilizations and his unpopularity with his kin.

## Middle and Modern History

### Underground Age

After the rise and 'first fall' of Vrakeus, Drarthers developed an extensive underground civilization. Their villages were hidden in forests, caves, and tunnels. They slowly became a predominantly crepuscular and nocturnal species, denoted by their marked activity during the sunrise, dusk, and night. They developed their unique culture, art, and architecture that reflects the features of their species. Most Drarther societies conducted trade and cultural exchange during the night, where Humans were least active. This also lead to their increased sensitivity to light.

Drarther societies that were able to make use of metaquarks fared better. Their villages were bigger and much better in terms of design and structural integrity, and they were able to build in clear fields, making use of metaquarks to camouflage them during daylight. Their use of metaquarks also accelerated their technological development.

When The Congregation was founded by Janus the Heroic in 781 CE, it was deemed a game-changer. At its core was Drarther-Human cooperation, which led to it being the longest running Drarther organization in history. With Humans working at their side, it was easier to know what their adversaries were up to.

Finally, in around 900 CE, all Drarthers were now able to harness metaquarks. Their technological and societal growth accelerated that they were effectively a century and a half ahead of humanity. They were also able to map the entire world more accurately than humans for more than a hundred years. While the first circumnavigation of the world by Humans was done in 1522, a Drarther named Vaya Castillo was able to do it in under a month in 1201, and she was able to make detailed accounts of the places she visited, expanding the Drarthers’ knowledge of the Earth.

### Rise in Hunting

In 1347 to 1380 CE, humans around the world rediscovered Drarther settlements and began to attack them. The reasons for this sudden, widespread discovery are debated, but a dominant theory states that Vrakeus might have been involved, and even between proponents of that theory, his potential motives are unclear.

In Europe however, the cause is well-known: Humans accused Drarthers of spreading the Black Plague. There is evidence of the disease originating from a Drarther researcher, who failed to keep their test subjects in control. Whether or not Vrakeus was involved is unclear. (A/N: Vrakeus was involved, but he was heavily influenced by Volkorrn.)

This prompted the Founders of Klerga, namely Okanor the Great, Helga the Strong, Kalaiz Halin the Wise, and Nami Yamamoto the Valiant to start the biennial Conference of Communities in 1348. The first Conference outlined the plans to do the most ambitious project in Drarther history: create a world of their own, outside of Earth.

### Klergan Age

**The Conference of Communities**

Often hailed as the greatest Drarthers of their time, Okanor the Great from the Holy Roman Empire, Helga the Strong of Mesoamerica, Kalaiz Halin from the Mali Empire, and Nami the Valiant of East Asia got together to create a settlement for all Drarthers.

The Four met each other during their travels around the world. In 1348, they organized the first worldwide conference of Drarther communities on Earth, now called the Conference of Communities. The location is alleged to be near current-day Rabat, the capital of Morocco. Some allege that the conference actually happened in Jerusalem instead.

The Conference of Communities is a biennial event, held since its first in 1348. In the first Conference, they discussed potential solutions to the prosecution of their species. The solution came from an unlikely source: a child, belonging to an African community. The child suggested islands in the sky to isolate themselves from humans.

Okanor the Great welcomed the proposal, but Kalaiz Halin, being one of the few Drarthers to gain an Astral Affinity, took it one step further: the island will be built outside of Earth.

At first, a majority of the communities rejected the proposal, saying that it is too far-fetched. The other Founders were also skeptical, but not to the same degree. Eventually, Okanor and Kalaiz proved that the idea was possible by showing the audience their great feats of power.

**Creation of Klerga**

Thus, from 1360 to 1400 CE, [[Klerga - Geography, Cosmology, and Civic Systems]] was built, a celestial body currently located in Earth-Sun Lagrange Point L3. It was first built above Point Nemo, the most remote place on Earth. They also formed several wormholes between Earth and Klerga for instantaneous travel. This also made them become a space-faring species centuries before humans launched their first satellite. Their discoveries living in space also advanced their scientific knowledge.

For the last several centuries, up to 60% Drarthers that have ever lived have done so in Klerga. They have also developed their own culture, art, architecture, and languages. For those who decided to live on Earth for various reasons, they lived inside hidden communities developed by The Congregation or other organizations. As Drarther civilization settled on their new world, many of their evolutionary traits gained from their time with humans were reversed slowly, especially their nocturnal behavior, but this reversal was also accelerated by cultural change.

Humans have long since stopped the hunting for them; in many of their cultures, their existence is considered a myth. The main reason for this is that Drarthers are hard to study and prove their existence. From an archeological standpoint, the metaquarks inside them makes their bodies decompose faster after their death, meaning that bones can easily be broken down by the particles, leading to Drarther fossils being extremely hard to find. From a historical standpoint, many Drarther writings were dismissed as fiction or mythology, and other writings deemed indecipherable, written in ancient Drarther scripts.

Them fading into obscurity in human history was also accelerated by propaganda and revisionist efforts by The Congregation and the Klergan Council. More recently though, they face a much larger threat with the rise of the internet.

# Biology and Evolution

---

## Rise of Draconic Features

Drarthers' physical features are both naturally evolved, and artificially created through [[Metaquarks]], a form of microscopic exotic matter. The first humans able to absorb metaquarks in the air evolved independently around the world in 100,000 BCE. The first ones died tragic and horrible deaths, leading the metaquark-bearing humans (MBHs) to near extinction. This changed when living Dragons of the time attacked the MBHs all over Earth. They did attack regular humans, but not as much towards the metaquark-bearing beings as the dragons were more attracted to them.

The attacks gave Drarthers varying amounts of draconic DNA, which lead to some of them evolving quickly to adapt to the particles, giving them more efficient metabolisms and greater strength than the humans at the time. Over time, the draconic DNA also started to interact with the metaquarks in their bloodstream, making them gain dragon-like features, like wings. Their blood also turned blue, a phenomenon still unexplained even by Drarther scientists of today.

## Winged and Wingless Drarthers

However, there is a marked difference between two groups of Drarthers. Winged and Wingless Drarthers came from two types of Dragon: those that could fly with wings, and those who did not, often using more metaquarks to fly. Winged Drarthers resemble more the dragons of Western culture, while Wingless Drarthers are more like their Asian counterparts. Hybrids between the two are also common.

Winged Drarthers are the de facto representation of Drarthers as a whole, since they possess the most well-known feature of their species. Wingless Drarthers often take the backseat in terms of representation, given that their physical features are less 'flashy' and look more like a human in the first place.

While Wingless Drarthers possess no wings to aid them in flight, they have far more efficient metaquark usage during flight and other bodily processes. Descending from dragons in Asia, they are more often than not more powerful than Winged Drarthers in the first place, owing to the sky serpents' positions as gods and forces of nature in Asian mythology. Sadly, this has been also a point of discrimination on them, as Winged Drarthers have come to dominate the image of their species in their history and Human legend.

Winged Drarthers are the most common, comprising of about 70% of the total Drarther population between Klerga and Earth. Wingless Drarthers make up about 24% of the population, with hybrids making up the rest at 6%.

Hybrids of Winged and Wingless Drarthers take on both features of the species, naturally. However, there is little predictability on which exact features from both parents that the offspring will inherit. Sometimes, a hybrid can have wings, but smaller than average, and also contain a fin on their spine, that is also smaller than average. In others, the offspring may look like a typical Winged Drarther. The one constant between hybrids is that they inherit more efficient metaquark usage from their Wingless parent.

## Physical Features

The wings of Winged Drarthers expanded through various forms, mostly due to either environmental pressures, or fluctuations of metaquarks within them. Wingless Drarthers on the other hand, developed fins on their spine, and their bodies also evolved to make use of metaquarks more efficiently in flight.

Both types of Drarthers also started to develop retractable claws at around 80,000 BCE. Eye colors started to diversify within Drarther communities in 42,000 BCE. The anatomically modern Drarthers emerged at around 12,000 BCE. Around this time, they also developed a rudimentary form of [Magnetoreception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoreception), which allows them to perceive altitude. These magnetoreceptors are present on each Drarther as a gem-like protrusion, often taking in the color of their eyes. On a Winged Drarther, the sensory organs are on their shoulders, on a Wingless Drarther, its on their fins.

Drarthers also started to develop pointy, curvy ears, meant for directing more sound above and behind them, which is useful during flight. Drarthers also started to see more dragon-like, reptilian skin in critical parts of their body, like the area around their eyes, parts of their hands and feet, or their limbs. Scales can also appear by themselves around the body, like freckles. Scales can spontaneously appear on a Drarthers body where a human touches them. Despite Drarther populations being spread out on Earth, their evolution were parallel to a degree, apart from other distinct traits like hair or skin color, which are of similar diversity to Humans'.

As they developed their ability to fly, the Winged Drarthers' skeletal structure changed drastically. Their bones became more hollow to save weight and make flying easier. This means that the average height of a Drarther is about 165.1 cm (5ft 5in), and their bones are much susceptible to breakage. The metaquarks within them help accelerate the healing process, though.

The Wingless Drarthers however, did not have to adapt much in terms of bone structure, due to their more efficient use of metaquarks in flight.

Generally, Drarthers have a wide variety of appearances. It can range from a body identical that of a Human, but with pointed ears, glowing eyes, and draconic wings, which are minimum qualities of a Drarther, to a body that straddles the line between Human and Dragon, which most humans call in their myths as “Dragonfolk”. These creatures are more often referred to as “Ascended Drarthers” or “Ascendants”.

## Lifespan and Growth

Drarther lifespans reached levels of modern humanity (around 70) by 2,000 BCE. Nowadays, average Drarther life expectancy is around 150. Adulthood is considered to start at around 24 years of age. An elder Drarther is considered to start at their 80s. The oldest Drarther to have ever survived at 212 years old was Baximus Hala, known for his pioneering work on Drartology (Drarther equivalent of Anthropology), philosophy, and literature.

Children Drarthers start learning how to fly at the age of seven, when their wings have been developed enough to sustain short bursts of flight, around 2 minutes. Adult Drarthers can fly continuously for four hours on average at 80km/h before needing to stop for a rest.

Adolescent Drarthers typically have two phases to their puberty: first is the Humanoid Stage, where the typical development from child to a mature adult takes place. The second is the Draconic stage: during the ages of 16 to 22, more Dragon-like features start to emerge, and they are able to tap into their [[The Elements and Affinities]] better. This trait is thought to have emerged during the Interaction Age, where children blending in better with humans allowed them to survive further into adulthood.

  

## Reproduction

Reproduction works similarly to humans. They become sexually mature in the middle of the Draconic stage of adolescence.

Because of the metaquarks inside of them, Drarthers tend to have lower fertility rates, with the metaquarks adversely affecting reproductive cells within their bodies. This often leads to miscarriages as well. Their sexual activites and/or libido levels are the around the same as an average human's. Even with lower fertility rates, the age Drarthers get into menopause or andropause are higher around 70 to 80 years old, meaning that Drarthers have a larger window to reproduce, even if their odds are still low.

Generally, the odds of successful births are better when they reproduce at the middle of their reproduction window.

## Flight and Bioavionics

Among Winged Drarthers, materalized wings developed by 900 BCE. Materalized wings are generally wider but slightly heavier, which gives them a noticeable disadvantage when flying. However, since those wings are wider, they can absorb more metaquarks than their Folded counterparts. Materalized wings evolved because of pressure brought on by living with humans. Drarthers with Materalized wings have an easier experience when blending in with Humans.

Their bioavionic system gives the magnetoreception and a sense of altitude. It developed around 10,000 BCE, with gem-like protrusions on their shoulders and/or along their spine. The colors of these protrusions often take on the color of their eyes. These organs give a Drarther a sense of speed, altitude, air pressure, and the magnetic field of the earth.

These developments meant there were trade-offs in other parts of their body. Their skeletal structure for example is far less dense than a human's. This allows them to be lighter, but are more prone to fractures. Even with their lighter bones and enhanced strength, Drarthers cannot fly with their wings alone. They still make unconscious use of metaquarks to channel air beneath them to generate lift, much like the real dragons that preceded them, and the airplanes that humans would soon create. 

## Eye Colors

Eye colors are diverse in Drarthers. Most eye colors are vibrant and have varying levels of luminescence in the dark. Eye color is also somewhat tied to one's ability to make use of metaquarks. The rarest of these are purple eyes, and some anecdotal evidence point to them being one of the most powerful Drarthers. Drarthers with heterochromia are equally rare and very powerful. The rest of Drarther eye colors are as follows, sorted by percentage of the population, with a margin of error of 1-3%:

1. Black - 29%, average power
2. Blue - 26%, average power
3. Green - 22%, average power
4. Gray - 15%, above average power
5. Red - 3%, very powerful, shines brighter
6. Brown - 2.5%, very powerful, eye color barely glows
    - Despite this, brown-eyed Drarthers are often discriminated and ostracized against since brown eyes are considered by many in society to be most human-like.
    - They however, are very popular for covert agencies like the Congregation, where natural brown eyes are a useful cover.
7. Amber - 1.5%, very powerful, shines brighter
8. Purple or Heterochromia - 1%, extremely powerful, shines the brightest

The heredity of eye colors are psuedo-random, however, with black, blue, and Green eyes statistically more likely to emerge than other eye colors. Drarther scientists still have not reached a consensus on the exact probabilities of Drarther eye colors.


# Psychology and Social Dynamics

---

## Society

Drarthers are usually independent and can survive individually unlike humans. When presented with the opportunity however, they will form some degree of social organization comparable to humans. Most Drarther groups range from the size of families to large towns. Drarthers tend to not form larger conurbations as a way of keeping themselves secretive.

[insert something about fictive kinship, how Drarthers frequently adopt orphaned children]

## Headfriends

Occasionally, Drarther can be seen staring into space and subvocalizing into themselves. They are more often than not conversing with their “headfriends”, a voice or even a semi-visible figure in their vision. These headfriends have a distinct personality and tone, often complementing the Drarther’s own.

These Headfriends are believed to be a personification of the metaquarks, emerging during the Interaction Age when Drarthers often lived alone due to various hazards or out of necessity. Some headfriends were reported to look and sound like senior family members or ancestors.

## Sleep

Drarthers are generally crepuscular, most active during dawn and dusk. Back then, most Drarthers were nocturnal, owing to their history. As most Drarthers are now born in Klerga, this behavior is slowly inverted over time—albeit this change is accelerated by cultural changes rather than evolutionary pressures.

When they sleep, Drarthers keep about a quarter of their brain awake, in order to stay on the lookout for potential threats. It developed around the time humans were hunting them. This is not a perfect system of course, for one thing, it mostly makes use of a Drarther's sense of hearing, smell, touch, and altitude (through magnetoreception). This means that false alarms are quite common, but its better than nothing during their time.

Nowadays, Drarthers find it more of a nuisance than a utility, since they face less environmental threats. They often sleep with sleeping aids—often lamps that are infused with metaquarks to create a calming effect. Without sleeping aids, Drarthers may find themselves getting false alarms. On average, Drarthers experience more [hypnic jerks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk) than humans. In worse cases, they get constant nightmares when they are unable to be waken up by that part of the brain. Another effect is sleep-talking, where a sleeping Drarther may appear to be responding to a conversation around them, more often that not, they are speaking nonsensically.
