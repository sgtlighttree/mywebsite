# Metaquarks

Metaquarks are rare, but naturally occurring elementary sub-atomic particles, with a size of about 150µm [(reference)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htPXMQ5s-yo). Unlike the similarly named quarks, which are the building blocks of atoms that in turn make up matter, metaquarks manipulate existing matter and the fundamental forces of the universe. They are also considered to be a form of [exotic matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_matter).

Further studies have also revealed that metaquarks can create matter. In controlled environments, a matter-antimatter pair is allowed to materialize, and a metaquark was introduced into the system. The antimatter particle was attracted to the metaquark, annihilating it in the process. This leaves the baryonic matter particle free, and helped to solve a fundamental problem in physics.

## Origins and History

---

Many samples of meteors that landed on Earth contained traces of metaquarks, providing clear evidence of the particles coming outside of Earth.. Around 66 million years ago, a meteor hit the Earth, causing the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. It also provided the Earth with a plurality of its metaquarks.

Metaquarks have not been formally studied by Humans until the 1960s. Such experiments would prove futile, however; capturing enough of the particles was a very arduous process. Even in a vacuum, dense metaquark packs acted erratically, making it harder to store, occasionally destroying the containers it was in. Currently, most metaquarks that were contained by Humans are hidden in scientific facilities, most notably in the premises of CERN.

[[Drarthers]] however, would be the first species to discover metaquarks and its power. They have taken notice of it since the 12th century, and have started experimenting with it since then. Major breakthroughs started in the mid-19th century, coinciding with Humanity's first discoveries on the atom. They were also able to innovate in metaquark containment and store it in special containers. Before that, they thought they just had 'magic', an unexplainable, mysterious force.

  

## Etymology, Names, and Linguistic Conventions

---

The name is a portmanteau of the words _meta_, a Greek word meaning “after” or beyond”), and _quark_, a type of elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of baryonic matter. It was jointly proposed in the 1969 by Congregation and Klergan Academy scholars and accepted by the Klergan Language Institute in 1973.

Before the 1970s though, many names existed to describe this special particle. Most often, it was simply called _magic_ in various languages due to its effects on the environment. In more academic and formal circles, the word “Biokruso” was used, derived from Ancient greek words _bios_ meaning “life” and _khrusos_ meaning “gold”. This word is still in semi-regular use along side “metaquarks”.

Some have criticised the new name, calling it an anglicism. Users of the particle still use “Biokruso” or have developed several shorthands and slang for the new term, as Drarthers are wont to do. Some include, but not limited to: metaqs, meqs, and em-kyus.

Whether or not Metaquarks need to be capitalized is another question. In academic and formal writing, both the Klergan Academy and the Klergan Language Institute recommend capitalization. In less formal settings, the KLI recognizes (note: not explicitly recommends) both capitalized and uncapitalized forms.

  

## Production and Universality of Metaquarks

---

Metaquarks have been found to be materializing in the vacuum of space together with an anti-metaquark pair, and then annihilating together, but in very scarce amounts. It is also theorized that Metaquarks can come from quasars, stating that electromagnetic radiation is not the only thing released from supermassive black holes. This suggests that metaquarks are universal, and may even be a fundamental ingredient to life—but this assertion is met with criticism.

Metaquarks produced in space are completely white; different atmospheric conditions can alter its color, but it does not appear to be affecting its relative energy output.

In general, Metaquark production can be intensified by certain atmospheric conditions, especially those that can harbor life, like on Earth and Klerga. These atmospheric conditions can make the anti-Metaquark collapse under air pressure, and leave the newly produced Metaquark free.

  

## Possession of Metaquarks

---

Due to their unique DNA, Drarthers naturally possess the Metaquarks in their body and are able to use them.

Metaquarks were very prevalent on Earth before human civilization began. The population of Metaquark-Bearing Humans were about 35% of the total human population on Earth before 4000BCE, 28% by 1000BCE, and 22% by 1CE. and slowly decreased as human population rose. By the end of the Industrial Era, the population of MBHs all over Earth were 1%. Today, the figure stands at about 0.0001%.

- While it may seem that more MBHs will be born as human population increases, the primary mitigating factor for this decrease is the prevalence of technology. While technology has little to no effect on metaquarks on living MBHs, technology and presence of electronics exponentially decreases the odds of an MBHs being born.

Drarthers use the vault organelle to store metaquarks, a very large structure within the eukaryotic cells. This allows them to stockpile the particles whenever going into areas with limited metaquark supply. This also gives them an edge over humans that have also acquired metaquarks. All human children of Human-Drarther couples possess this ability, but requires additional training to store and make use of them, as opposed to a Drarther. Humans on the other hand, are able to store metaquarks inside the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell.



  

## Metaquark Mechanics

---

Metaquarks can exist as individual particles, but they are usually seen as a _pack_. In Earth-like atmospheric conditions, a pack of metaquarks is often gold in color, and usage of metaquarks often generate a golden wisp of smoke from its user.

In presence of pack of metaquarks, they manipulate matter in ways that that violate the laws of physics and thermodynamics. In those cases, fires have been seen sparking over frozen lakes, food appearing in front of hungry people wishing for something to eat, and streams of water coming out of solid rock. In older times, these cases would have been deemed "witchcraft", or "magic", according to Human folklore. The particles enabled Drarthers to fly with their wings that are actually aerodynamically flawed, and it also allowed them minimal control over physics.

Metaquarks can vary in mass, but they always take up a volume of 2 cubic milliliters. This means that their density can vary. The average mass of a pack of metaquarks is 20mg, which gives us a density of 10g/cm3, which is between the density of copper and silver [(source)](https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/density). The power of metaquarks is proportional to their density in a pack. In an average Drarther's body, there are around 4000* packs of metaquarks flowing freely in their blue bloodstream.

*(actually 2^6 = 4096 rounded down)

There is a proposed theory that metaquarks have two 'modes': Transformation mode and Negative Mass mode. Negative mass is necessary for wormholes to function, the Klergan wormholes are evidence of this. This has not been definitively proven, as the Founders' methods of creating the wormholes are unknown, and that it is risky to perform experiments or tests with the wormholes.

### Usage

The act of using metaquarks to manipulate matter is called Shaping, governed by the Rule of Lakamej (Klergan word for balance). This rule says that the mass of a manipulated matter cannot change, but it's density and volume can. Any extraneous matter created in violation of this rule will decay as the universe balances itself.

So despite the metaquarks' potential, they are not a silver bullet. Metaquarks cannot be used to make more of them—they can naturally materialize within the vacuum of the universe, but their reproduction can be enhanced in certain atmospheric conditions, like Earth's atmosphere.

Technically, one can manipulate a small rock into something more substantial, like a large building. This exponential increase in volume will require a far more powerful and dense pack of metaquarks. Since metaquarks' volume maxes out at 2 cubic centimeters, packs can increase in density quickly. The more dense a pack is, the instability of it increases. Unstable packs of metaquarks are very dangerous for Drarthers. For an average Drarther, a pack of metaquarks with a greater density than 15g/cm3 can have serious consequences.

Less dense metaquark packs are of course more stable, last longer, but can only manipulate smaller amounts of matter. In a way, the law of conservation of energy is followed to some degree.

In general, short, powerful bursts of metaquark usage can increase its instability. Prolonged powerful bursts of metaquarks are catastrophic. Worst case scenarios include:

- Metaquark Implosion, where metaquarks become so dense it forms a short-lived supermassive object within the Drarther's body, which disintegrates it under its own gravity. This is the least common but most brutal consequence.
- Metaquark Exhaustion, which can be fatal for a Drarther. The moment their internal metaquark density reaches 0.2g/cm3, the metaquarks get diluted in their bloodstream, which can lead to fatigue, and in worse cases, death. While this is the most common consequence, it since this is also the most preventable. On average, Exhaustion is relieved after several days, but in some cases it can even last months. Some especially trained Drarthers can 'lend' their own metaquarks to another Drarther suffering from Exhaustion, to help alleviate the symptoms.
- Metaquark Passivity. This comes after Metaquark Exhaustion, if a Drarther hasn't completely replenished their metaquarks. This means that the metaquarks inside them still exist and are stable, but have gone passive. Consequences vary, from an inability to fly due to their wings' failure to actively push air around, or not being able to do anything with metaquarks at all. While not uncurable, treatment for Passivity can take years to decades.

Anecdotal evidence suggest that uniquely powerful Drarthers can intensify the effect of metaquarks on reality; some Drarthers have been reported to make rifts or wormholes in space-time and do things that are unthinkable in our current understanding of physics.

- One noted example would be the Founders, who possessed such power to be able to build Klerga, a celestial body above the Sun.

### Energy Release

The amount of energy in each metaquark is unknown, and the general direction of metaquark research has shifted to be more about using them efficiently instead of defining how much energy a singular particle possesses.

### Metaquark Acquisition

Drarthers absorb metaquarks through their wings and hair. Drarthers with Folded wings always have a part of their wing present, so they are able to absorb the particles much faster. The ones with Materialized wings, however, can only absorb particles through their hair when their wings aren't present, which can put them at a disadvantage. These Drarthers however can sustain short bursts of power slightly more than their Folded counterparts.

Speaking of hair, there is a reason why bald hairstyles aren't present in Drarther culture. Much of the particle collection through hair happens at the head, which is also why many male Drarthers prefer to have facial and body hair. Trimming the hair would only put them at a disadvantage. For women, they also take in more metaquarks in general due to their longer hair. Technically, one can use metaquarks for them to grow more hair, especially when they get older. The problem with that method however is that older Drarther bodies are less able to handle metaquarks.

Metaquarks are the life force of Drarthers. Without them, they cannot survive.

Metaquarks can be acquired by any human as long as they surround themselves with Drarthers or Human MBBs (Elementals). This allows their body to slowly absorb and adapt to the presence of metaquarks, because metaquarks tend to stick to any living being, but in trace amounts. A human is able to do very basic Shaping when they've reached similar metaquark concentrations as any other MBB, but to fully activate it, they have to experience a sudden physically or emotionally traumatic event, including, but not limited to: a vehicular accident, war, crime, or the loss of a loved one. One such well-known but rare example is getting struck by lightning. All of the most powerful human magicians were born this way.

If a human hasn’t fully activated their metaquarks, they require constant exposure and mingling with other Elementals. Otherwise, the metaquarks within them will slowly shed themselves and render them powerless.

### Metaquark Storage

Drarthers and MBBs store their metaquarks in the [Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_(organelle)) organelle, a large structure in human cells. In normal humans, it is typically the mitochondria. The metaquarks move to the Vault organelle once the metaquarks are “activated”.

### Interactions with Human Technology

To help bind Metaquarks to an object or a piece of technology as a power source, a set of symbols has to be inscribed, written with a metaquark-infused writing device. The inscription also has to be handwritten, for reasons unknown.

Most human-made technology malfunction in Metaquark-heavy environments. For them to work properly, an M-Q Conduit needs to be attached to the device to absorb the Metaquarks. Such conduits can have flexible applications, but most conduits act like power delivery devices, providing additional electrical power to the device. A conduit can take any shape or form, depending on its use case. Phones, for example, need a special case that acts as the conduit. These cases convert free metaquarks into power for the device, and help resist signal interference from charged metaquarks.


## Metaquark Information

---

Metaquarks are capable of storing information or commands of what its originator, usually a Drarther, wants it to do. This is usually used in cases where the desired effect does not have to be immediate, like a trap. Another example is manipulating human-made technology with metaquarks; the particles need to get stored in an M-Q Conduit within the device. The metaquarks inside the conduit then execute the desired effect on the device.

The information-storing capability of metaquarks is also used as the Drarther equivalent of wireless internet, used by humans. The information within metaquarks can also be encrypted or scrambled to enhance its privacy. Not that Drarthers like to snoop, but it is now a default setting because of so many messages being accidentally delivered to the wrong person due to this purely end-to-end system.

It is inefficient in larger applications though, such as broadcasting, or transferring larger amounts of data. Actively charged metaquarks carrying larger amounts of information experience more resistance in the air. Drarthers default to radio waves for that purpose.

## Metaquark-Bearing Humans

---

MBHs are typically humans that are considered by their fellows as 'unusual' or 'elite', like top athletes, or more infamously, sorcerers, spiritual eccentrics, and the like. They often end up migrating to Klerga as a safe space for their activities. Drarthers call them Ferahanta, which is Standard Klergan for 'world-wanderer'.

### Metaquark Stones

Since metaquarks are technically a form of matter, albeit exotic, they can still exist in various states of matter. The most powerful physical representation of metaquarks are Metaquark Stones, objects that contain a very dense pack of metaquarks. Such objects commit egregious violations of the laws of physics, especially the law of conservation of energy.

Such Stones can not only manipulate matter, but also create and destroy it. In addition, a Stone can even be used to create anomalies in space-time with ease.

The Stones are usually gold in color, with a gemstone like sheen and form.

Creating a Stone requires the extraction of metaquarks of at least 256 (4^4) Drarthers, and immense amounts of energy. No one has succeed in successfully created a true Stone. A true Stone does not destruct by itself, regardless of how much energy is used. The only way to destroy a stone is for its creator to use itself to disintegrate itself. A Stone is deactivated when its creator dies, until it is reactivated by the first person to touch it.

The closest attempt towards a true Stone was made by Vrakeus, head of the [[The Windwakers]], but the stone only lasted exactly 46 seconds of use. His Stone destroyed itself because the metaquarks within it were only extracted from 32 Drarthers. These stones are called “Blood Stones,” chiefly because of its methods of creation.

### Metaquark Bomb

One of the most destructive weapons in the universe, a metaquark bomb can contain as much as half the power of a supernova.

  

## Fringe Theories on Metaquarks

---

There is an emerging, but somewhat unpopular hypothesis within the Klergan scientific community: Metaquarks are not particles of exotic matter, but sentient microorganisms. The hypothesis goes that since metaquarks can store information, it must have some sort of brain or memory, like most earthly organisms.

This is very unpopular, regardless, since the theory does not account for metaquarks existing in the vacuum of space, nor does it account for the fact that memory storage on an organism is a challenge.
