Added the [Skybound]({{ '/skybound/' | relative_url }}) section. Getting it to work wasn't as painful as wrestling with media, but somehow it led to the site being down for a while. Speaking of media, turns out not every browser likes AV1 or even VP9, so I've settled to making everyone else but me happy by using H264.
