Jekyll is nice, writing in markdown feels more at home. After the wordpress drama I feel less likely to be setting up a new website there. Besides, it just passed a real-world test when Adrian, an longtime friend I ran into at Komiket, browsed my portfolio.

Getting fade-in-out transitions to work failed, but maybe that's for the best.
