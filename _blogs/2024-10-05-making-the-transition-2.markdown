I'm going to run out of API credits.

Getting the media previews on the home page was painful, but we got there. I don't think I'd be changing up the colors much, dark mode isn't that great for people with astigmatism, but I'm still not so sure about the font, currently Manrope. Maybe I should splurge and get one from pangrampangram.com, but Armin Grotesk is still too expensive.

Also, V1 of the website is [archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20241005154048/https://sgtlighttree.github.io/mywebsite/). Feels strange to have a much more permanent-ish record on the internet now.

Addendum October 7, 2024: Looks like the archive broke and V1 is lost. Looks like I was right in adding the "-ish" on "permanent".

Addendum January 13, 2025: Looks like the archive got it back again, but I only archived the homepage.
